# generalized-health-checkup
The website generates a generalised health report calculating details related to fitness which even the user might be unaware of like BMI, BMR, body fat calculator, calorie calculator, ideal weight calculator, etc. It is a responsive website use in mobiles, tablets, laptops and other devices too.
There are different websites where the user has to specify which detail they want, but here the user is provided with a generalised report which covers most of the details calculated from different calculators, eventually the user gets to know the different details in "one go". All these details are calculated with just the basic details like height, weight and gender. This is user-friendly and the user is also notified if the person has to consult with a doctor in such cases. The website is created with html, CSS, Python, Flask.
